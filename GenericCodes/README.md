This folder contains generic codes which can be used throughout the term. You will find used as code blocks throughout the experiments as they are introduced. Later in the term we will no longer provide structured notebooks and you will refer to these generic scripts to use in your own notebooks.

* `DataPackandTrim_2024_v0.1.ipynb` - takes oscilloscope data from the tablet oscilloscopes, downsamples the data and analyzes noise to determine uncertainties; optionally trims the data to a specified range
* `Fitting-general_2025_v0.1.ipynb` - used to fit non-linear functions to packed data

In week 5, you will do an assignment with linear fits based on the results from the previous 3 weeks. The code for these is different than the general fitting code above, and may be useful for other things where you would like to do a 1- or 2-parameter linear fit. Both codes take `.csv` formatted data with 4 columns (expecting $x$, $\delta x$, $y$, $\delta y$) as generated by the `data_entry2` package.
* `Fitting-Linear-1Parameter-rev2024.ipynb` - performs a 1-parameter linear fit of the form $y=mx$
* `Fitting-Linear-2Parameter-rev2024.ipynb` - performs a 2-parameter linear fit of the form $y=mx+b$
