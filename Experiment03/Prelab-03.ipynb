Since you're not reading a file in this time, the code is already modified to directly read the arrays above, but you will need to set up the inputs to use the appropriate function. Try using the same \"guesses\" as you input as the parameters, as well as parameters that are very different to see how the routine responds. Start by generating a dense grid of data, where by eye you can clearly see the oscillations, then try sparse data. If your guesses are exact, the fit will likely still return similar values, but if you change the guesses the fit will find a new local minimum."

    "Let's take a bit closer look at how we are treating noise. The \"Data Pack and Trim\" routine we've given you uses the ($1\\sigma$) standard deviation of your selected region to determine the noise. If your noise is gaussian, which it often is if you have fluctuating values, then this is very reasonable. However, you have probably seen that for some of your data in Experiments 1 or 2 sometimes you just see bit noise where the values are mostly constant, but sometimes jump to another mostly constant value. This comes from the digitization of the data, and depending on the acquisition parameters can overwhelm any gaussian noise present in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bit noise works like any other digital noise: the \"true\" value lies somewhere between with equal probablility since we simply have no way to tell. Formally this can be treated as a \"boxcar\" distribution of possible values and should be given an uncertainty of $\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{resolution}/\\sqrt{3}$ which is the standard deviation of this boxcar distribution with a width given by the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Experiment 3 your data will have a fairly large dynamic range: the initial response to a kick will be large, and you'll want as much of the ringdown as you can use. With a large signal, and some filtering or averaging within the oscillsocope you are very likely to see digitization/bit noise this week."
