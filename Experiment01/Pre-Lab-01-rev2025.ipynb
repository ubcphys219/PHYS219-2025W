The benefit of using a Jupyter notebook for these labs is that you can seamlessly alternate between Markdown and Code cells. In a PHYS 219 lab session, we will generally have periods of notetaking when you are familiarizing yourself with the equipment for an experiment, coming up with a measurement plan, explaining your results and analysis, as well as planning and executing improvements. At other times, you will be using Python code to perform analysis and calculations on your data. A Jupyter notebook thus allows you to seamlessly transition between notetaking and analysis.

    "## Plotting Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost done this pre-lab, but this is the most important task. We will be using Python extensively for plotting and analyzing data. To get started, we have a basic piece of code below that will plot a set of data stored in the file `CSVTest.csv`. This code uses two libraries to handle data arrays `numpy` (commonly imported as `np` to make commands shorter) and create plots `matplotlib` (commonly imported as `plt`). Quick guides are posted on Canvas for both of these packages if you want to better understand them or use them more fully. Everywhere you see a command starting with `np` or `plt` you are calling functions from these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Comma separated values\", or .csv, files store arrays of numbers and we will be using this file format for all of your data storage.\n",
    "Begin by uploading CSVTest.csv into the same Jupyter directory that you are using for this PreLab01.ipnyb .\n",
    "To take a look at this data file, double-click on CSVTest.csv . \n",
    "\n",
    "You should see that this is a four-column array, with the first two rows containing labels and units for the columns. This will be our standard format for plotting two-dimensional data. In this case, the data is Voltage versus Time, including uncertainty for both Voltage and Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that array indexing in Python begins at Zero. So the first row is actually Row 0. In this file, Row 0 contains labels for each column, and Row 1 contains the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will ignore Row 0 and Row 1, and make a plot of the Voltage (Column 2) versus Time (Column 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Modify the code yourself, giving a personalized title, and adjust the axes so that the data fills the frame of the plot.</mark>\n"
