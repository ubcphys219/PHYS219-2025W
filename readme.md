Repository for PHYS 219 Winter Term 1 2025

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks designed to pair with the UBC PHYS 219 Experimental Physics course. Updates will be made throughout the term as needed and notebooks will be added for upcoming labs.

Notebooks will be labelled with the in-lab experiment or pre-lab activity they are associated with.
